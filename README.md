# elixir-udemy-course

Working my way through [The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/).

# Approach

Here's how I am approaching this course.

* Dedicate a half an hour block of time each day.
* Play the videos at 1.75x.
  - The structure of the course is aimed at new developers so goes into detail on some concepts that I am already familiar with.
* Watch the start of a section. If I can see where it is headed, do some experimentation on my own to see if I can pre-empt what is going to be shown.
* Watch the remainder of the section and compare with what I did.
* Do some further experimentation.
* Make note of any questions/comments/thoughts I have about what I've seen on a [github wiki page](https://github.com/biggianteye/elixir-udemy-course/wiki/Notes).
* Commit everything I have done in the half an hour block with the commit message showing the things that have been covered.
